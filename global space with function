///// how function works in js

// here we make the same name variable multiple times.x variable has made in many place

var x = 10;
console.log(x) // 10
/// as we know we made x variable in amny places but here we get value of 10. but why because when you do console.log(x) it search that variable only in global space(mat lab jo varibale function/object/class ke bahar alag se bane hai). so that's why it only read x variable which is made outside by func. and let's say we remove the original x variable from global space(jo x variable bahar banan hai) it will give a error and that is x is not defined why because as we study coinsole.log() in global space only search varibale in global space not under in func/class/obj or other in data structure.


function MyName(){
    var x = 7;
    console.log(x)
}

function MyName2(){
    var x = 8;
    console.log(x)
}
