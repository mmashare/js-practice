////////// array study

let array = [5,5.5,"apple",null,undefined];
console.log(array)

//// changing elements in array

let fruit = ["apple","mango","banana"];
fruit[1] = "myfruit"
console.log(fruit)

//// checking is it a array? 

let fruit1 = ["apple","mango","banana"];
console.log(Array.isArray(fruit1)) // true

//// confusing thing in js(sometimes js include array in oject)

let arr = [1,2,3];
// it will print object even though it's a array, because sometimes array also included in array
console.log(typeof arr) // object
