/// what is first class function?
/// a function can be a first class function if there is these 3 points are applying.
////// A function can be passed as an argument to other functions.
///// or A function can be returned by another function.
//// or A function can be assigned as a value to a variable.


////// Example 1 - Assigning a function to a variable.
/// because yaha hamne function ko koi bhi name nhi diya hai so it's called a Anonymous Function.
    var myfun = function(){
        
        console.log("hello world")
    }
    myfun()

// Note - if we want to give a name to that funtion we can, if we give a name to this function it won't effect anything.But if you give a name to this function it will help you in debugging process.

////// Example 2 - Passing a function as an argument

    function sayHello(){
        return "hello"
    }
    
    function gretting(parm1){
        console.log(parm1,"jimmy")
    }

/// here we pass a function into a fun as an argument.
gretting(sayHello()) 


////// Example 3 - Returning a function by a function
    function myfun2(){
        return ()=>{ /// here we return a func by a func
            console.log("hello worldddddd ")
        }
    }
var h = myfun2();
h()
