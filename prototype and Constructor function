// prototype is a type of object which is provide by JS-engine to store some properties and method in it. but js-engine only provide prototype which has data type object(object,array,funcion,date).
//// but before studying prototype we have to know what is Constructor Function.
//// basically we use function constructor to create objects/instance of real object.
// example

// constructor function
function Person () {
    this.name = 'Johnnn',
    this.age = 23,
    this.greet = function () {
        console.log('hello');
    }
}

// create an object. these objects inherit all property and method from constructor function
const person = new Person();
console.log(person.name)

/// but why we use constructor function to create objects, why we don't clone obj normally
// here we clone objects normally

let person1 = {
    name: 'Sam'
}
// here we put person obj in student
let student = person1;
student.name = 'John';   // here we change one property in student let's see it effect on originally object or not.
console.log(person1.name); // John
// as you can see if you change one property from the clone it will effect on origanl also. that's why we use Constructor Function to make object/instance of orignal object. let's see the difference between normal obj vs Constructor Function.

function Person () {
    this.name = 'John',
    this.age = 23
}

// creating objects
let person6 = new Person();
let person7 = new Person();

// adding property to person1 object
person6.gender = 'male';

// adding method to person1 object
person6.greet = function () {
    console.log('hello');
}

person6.greet();   // hello

// Error code

// person7.greet(); this got an error 
// here we got an error person2 doesn't have greet() method. because when you make a object from contruction function it makes seprate copy of every obj. means if you add/update anything in person1 it doesn,t effect on person2 obj.and also don't effect on orignal Constructor Function.

////// as we have studied constructor function, now we study prototype.

function Person5(name, job, yearOfBirth){   
    this.name= name;
    this.job= job;
    this.yearOfBirth= yearOfBirth;
}
// this will show Person's prototype property.
console.log(Person5.prototype); // run this code in browser then you see a object that is prototype in which variuosvaious ther method already present that we use i daily life.
